# SpendShare: Developer Onboarding

Welcome to the SpendShare development team! This guide serves as the main entry point for understanding how to contribute to the SpendShare application.

SpendShare is a financial application designed to simplify expense sharing with a unique focus on cryptocurrency-based settlements. Our goal is to build a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform.

## Development Areas

Development is primarily split into two main areas: Backend and Frontend.

*   **Backend Development:** Focuses on the API, business logic, database interactions, and the core functionalities of SpendShare. If you're working on data processing, API endpoints, or core application logic, refer to the [Backend Development Guide](./backend_development_guide.md).

*   **Frontend Development:** Focuses on the user interface, user experience, and interaction with the backend API. If you're working on UI components, page layouts, or how users interact with the app, refer to the [Frontend Development Guide](./frontend_development_guide.md).

## Core Principles for All Developers

*   **Collaboration:** Communicate effectively with other team members.
*   **Code Quality:** Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
*   **User Focus:** Always keep the end-user experience in mind.
*   **Security:** Prioritize security in all aspects of development.
