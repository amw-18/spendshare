# SpendShare: Your Guide to Easy Expense Sharing

Welcome to SpendShare! We're here to make sharing expenses with friends, family, or housemates simple and clear. Our goal is to let you track who paid for what, and eventually, make settling up super flexible, even with cryptocurrencies.

**The Big Idea: Share Expenses, Settle Your Way (Soon with Crypto!)**

    *   **Use different currencies:** Add expenses in Dollars, Euros, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other currency the app supports.
    *   **Split it up:** Decide how the expense should be divided among participants. You can split it equally or specify different amounts for different people.

    *   See how much you owe others in total.
    *   These balances are shown for each currency you've used.

## What's Coming Soon: Flexible Settlements with Crypto!

While you can currently track all your shared expenses and see who owes whom, the feature to actually *settle* these balances (especially using your preferred cryptocurrencies) is something we're actively working on. 

Soon, you'll be able to:
*   Tell the app which cryptocurrencies you prefer for getting paid back.
*   Settle up debts directly with others, with the app helping you figure out the amounts, even if the original expense was in a different currency.
